This is the project for ECE568, at UofT.

- The program probably can only run on UG machines at UofT.
- Test files are in ./ptest
- Project files are in ./cpp
- Only Loop Invariant Code Motion is implemented and the final speedup is 1.58.
- A script called exam.pl is provided to assist the test.
- For instance, command "perl exam.pl mmult" will test the speedup on the case "mmult.tmp".

-Enjoy!
